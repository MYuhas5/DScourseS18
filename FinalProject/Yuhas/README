Step 1: Load script FP_DC.R
Step 2: Edit object 'dird' and change to local file repository where CSV files for raw datasets are contained
Step 3: Install and Load all called libraries
Step 4: Run data cleaning and confirm final number of datapoints equal to 2348
Step 5: Run Section on creating tasks and prediction algorithms
Step 6: Set 10 fold CV and 10 random sample resampling
Step 7: Create parameter options for KNN and SVM
Step 8: Run Tuning sections
Step 9: Confirm parameters of 39 for KNN and cost = 1 gamma = 4 for SVM
Step 10: Run Training models
Step 11: Make Predictions using the Test Data
Step 12: RUn performance testing on final predictions
Step 13: Confirm value of 0.2638 for KNN accuracy
Step 14: Confirm value of 0.2808 for SVM accuracy
Step 15: Create summary tables and figures
