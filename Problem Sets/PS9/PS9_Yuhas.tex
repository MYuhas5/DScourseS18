\section{Question 5}
The dimensions of housing.train are 404 by 450. 
\section{Question 6-8}
 According to R, Housing.train had improper column naming 
conventions and therefore was unusable as an acceptable entry into 'data = ' for 
initialization of the theTask variable.  I was unable to find a work around or a 
solution, but as best I can tell when creating the data set the naming convention 
places to period symbols side by side like so '..' This is the only explanation I 
could find.  I will attempt to obtain help from Dr. Ransom prior to class to fix 
this issue but may be unable to change this document before the deadline.
